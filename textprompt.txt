I will provide you with the text of an article. Based on the content, summarize it sentence by sentence. For each sentence in the summary

Identify a key concept or keyword(s) that represents the core idea of that sentence and can be used later to search for relevant video clips.
Return the summary as two lists:
List 1: Each sentence of the summary, focusing on the core message.
List 2: The corresponding keyword(s) for each sentence, to be used in video searches.
The output should be formatted as a list in python with two sublists, with List 1 containing the summarized sentences and List 2 containing the associated keyword(s). If you cannot identify clear keywords, make an educated guess based on the articleâ€™s themes."
