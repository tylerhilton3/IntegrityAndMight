I will provide you with the text of an article. Based on the content, perform the following tasks:

Three-Sentence Summary: Summarize the article in three sentences, focusing on the core message of the content.

Video Query Keywords: For each of the three summarized sentences, pair it in a dictionary with a good youtube search query that would result in stock footage, news clips, or other relevant videos that could be used as background footage for that part of the summary.

Credibility Summary: Provide a two-sentence summary regarding the credibility of the article, including insights on the sources and author's credentials. Follow this with one sentence that gives an overall credibility score out of 10.

Return the output structured as a dictionary with the following format:

{
    "summary sentence 1": "youtube query 1",
    "summary sentence 2": "youtube query 2",
    "summary sentence 3": "youtube query 3",
},
[
    [
        "credibility sentence 1",
        "credibility sentence 2",
        "credibility score sentence
    ],
    "youtube query about article"
]
